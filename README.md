# TicTacToeNeuralNetwork
## Overview 
In this project, I train a Neural Network using reinforcement techniques and the concept of Monte Carlo Estimations to learn how to play TicTacToe. Although a Neural Net may not be the best solution for creating a Tic Tac Toe bot, I want to create a project that allows me to better understand some Machine Learning concepts.
